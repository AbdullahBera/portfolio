## A Spectrum of Thoughts I

Is human solidarity a lie? Have we lured ourselves to an abysmal we are struggling to deconstruct? The question I painstakingly ponder about these days is where are we heading in the light of the two questions above? The world is a picturesque place when raising awe inspiring quotes and sharing touching stories that carry us away to far utopias we imagine living in. However, even though, I believe, imagining is a potent metaphor that keeps us living and believing, it is also a robust simile capable to plunge our emotions, which powers our belief system, to dysfunction fatally. Imagining is actually hoping to live and believe the wild thoughts that are electrified in our only utopic world, our neuron system. So as important it is to imagine it is also very crucial to make those imaginations a reality. 

Since, the first humans, Adam and Eve, humanity has incessantly imagined for something unique, however, to specifically focus on one most renowned imagination that is, “making the world a better place to live”. Indeed, we have made the world a more convenient and luxurious place to live, technology has touched and changed the lives of millions, albeit, does this mean that the world is a better place to live in? I have come to classify “making the world a better place” by scrutinizing the relationship of people from different ethnic groups, religions, and socio-economic statuses’ with people from completely different backgrounds. For instance, from the day Martin Luther King Jr. gave his iconic speech at the Lincoln Memorial in front of thousands of Americans in 1964, we now see that people’s attitude towards Black Americans changed, however, even though the fight for black lives in the United States has gone a long way, there are still long distances that need to be covered. Unfortunately, we have forgotten the might of unity in diversity, the world we live in today may be witnessing unprecedented levels of bigotry, classification, and patriotism. These attitudes are fueled by politicians on media outlets in an environment where grave economic trade warfares are clashing across continents, where world humanitarian crises’ are disintegrating the dignity of the human race, and in an environment where cherry-picked political arguments are ignited to accumulate the support of voters who are fed up of passive politicians. When all these cons are added and broadcasted through media outlets in a way that further boasts statements about bigotry, classification, and patriotism to masses who are fatigued of hearing empty remarks from inadequately educated politicians, the masses start searching for hope in marginal figures to change the face of the world they live in. 

In a dynamic world in which change is now an inevitable upshot for each passing day, I cannot thoroughly formulate an answer to the questions and cons I am curious about for today and tomorrow when everything is swiftly taking place faster than the speed of light. But, I have a firm belief in the root cause of the questions and cons I stated above. This belief which I discovered from Ibn Sina’s research is about how he makes a clear distinction between what is good and bad, he emphasizes that badness is overlooking another person. He continues by stating that, “For a person not to overlook another person, that person has to be aware of his self-existence”, this actually connects with my belief that each living being has a unique diamond in their existence, which must be discovered by them, and their connection with us. Moreover, when I came across this statement by Ali Ibn Abi Talib, “Do not seek to know the truth by looking at the people, but first come to know the truth, for then will you only recognize its people”, I was mesmerized to believe the potential of this statement after much thinking. 

In conclusion, in a dynamic world where promises are made and promises are sold, human solidarity may have come to be a lie today and we may have lured ourselves into believing that we have made the world a better place to live, while, in my opinion, we have actually lured ourselves into an extended world of bigotry, classification, and patriotism with all the changes that have taken place. However, as quoted in the movie Shawshank Redemption, “Remember, Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. I will be hoping that this letter finds you, and finds you well”, that is why I say there is reason to hope that things will be different tomorrow and that is why we will continue to hope for making our imaginations become reality in a world where anything is possible.
